            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT NOBLE LORD, THE LORD EDWARD, EARLE of Bedford, grace mercie and peace, from God the Father, and from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG ſundrie meanes and helps of furthering of the Goſpell of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, (right noble Earle) vvhereby, ſince the time of the bleſsed Apoſtles, much good hath bin done to the Church of God: the vvriting and printing of godly treatiſes hath bene one of the chiefeſt. For as hereby not onely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hereſies of all ſorts haue long ago bin confuted and laid in the duſt, but in later times the nevve damnable doctrines of
<pb facs="tcp:13294:3"/>the Antichriſt of Rome, conuinced and quite in a maner ouerthrovvn: ſo not only the principall points of true religion, haue excellently bene handled and generallie made knovvn, but manie obſcure and hard places of the ſacred Scripture illightened and vnfolded. For this cauſe being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to employ my poore talent to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt aduantage that I can, and to vſe the beſt meanes I am able of doing good, I thought good to beſtovve my labour and leiſure in furthering of the Church of God by inke and paper, and to vvrite a comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie on ſome part of Canonicall Scripture, and namely on this excellent booke of the Prouerbes. The cauſes vvhy I rather choſe to handle &amp; interpret this booke then any of the other, as they vvere verie manie, ſo among the reſt theſe vvere the chiefeſt, to vvit, that the morall ſentences therein contained are moſt fit to be conſidered in theſe carnall times, that they are the verie keyes of knovvledge, and rules of all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, that ſometimes I had publikely read and expounded them all, and finally, that they are peereleſſe pearles, meet to be
<pb facs="tcp:13294:3"/>preſented vnto ſuch perſons of high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as your Lordship is. There is no parcell of the vvritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvord, but you may receiue exceeding frute thereby, if it pleaſe your Lordship to looke thereinto: ſo that if you take anie part of the Scripture to reade or to exerciſe your ſelfe in, you can not take amiſſe as vve are vvont to ſay. The ſacred hiſtories, contained in the fiue bookes of Moſes, and in the bookes of Ioſua, Iudges, Ruth, Samuell, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemia, Heſter, vvhereunto the Goſpels and the Acts of the Apoſtles are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, vvill tell you things paſt and done manie yeares ago. The propheſies, among vvhich the Reuelation of S. Iohn is to be numbred and doth indeed excell, vvill shevve you vvhat things are to come to paſſe hereafter, and vvere, after the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of them, to be accomplished in their times. Eccleſiaſtes or the booke of the Preacher, vvill admonish you of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the vvorld, a point verie needfull as for all mortall vvights, ſo eſpecially for noble perſonages to conſider. In the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of S. Paule, Iames, Peter, Iohn, and
<pb facs="tcp:13294:4"/>Iude, you may ſee and heare vvhat the Lord ſaith to the Churches, and vvhat duties he requireth at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. By the Pſalmes of Dauid, and the ſong of ſongs, you may be taught &amp; ſtirred vp to pray and ſing, inaſmuch as the mones and grones of the Prophets in the one are regiſtred euerie vvhere, and the voice as it vvere of the bridegrome and the bride reſounded in the other. To conclude, the lamentation of the Prophete Ieremie, vvhich Gregorie Nazianzen neuer read but the tears did trickle dovvn his cheeks, vvil moue you to mourne for the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Sion, and dravve you to performe that dutie vvhereunto the Apoſtle exhorteth, vvhen he vvilleth vs to vveepe vvith thoſe vvho vveepe. Euen as then the buſie bee, vvhen she flieth into ſome faire and pleaſant garden, and lighteth ſometimes here and ſometimes there as it falleth out, ſucketh out ſome ſvveetneſſe out of euerie floure and herbe vvhereon she ſitteth: ſo your Lordship looking into the volume of the ſacred Scripture, and reading ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this parcell thereof, ſometimes that,
<pb facs="tcp:13294:4"/>shall receiue by euerie booke therein ſuch comfort and profit, as vvill cauſe you to preferre the ſame before the hony and the honie combe. But if there be anie part of the vvord of God among the reſt, vvhich may be called a garland of heauenly flovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or out of vvhich your Lordship may reape moſt precious frute, it is this vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie booke of Salomons Prouerbs. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as it vvere in a criſtall glaſſe, you shall ſee the nature of God, the maners of men, the comely countenance of vertue, the vglie shape of vice, the image of the true church, &amp; the ſtate of the vvhole vvorld. Hovve manie and hovv notable things are herein ſpoken, of Gods Predeſtination, prouidence, iuſtice, vviſedome and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie? Hovv diuinely are the natures, the offices, and the vvorkes of Ieſus Christ herein deſcribed? Hovv liuely are adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, drunkards, ſluggards, miſers, proud, vvrathfull, foolish, and enuious perſons, herein painted out as it vvere in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours? On the contrarie ſide, hovv excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently are the properties and revvards of the faithfull, the iuſt, the meeke, the
<pb facs="tcp:13294:5"/>thriftie, the liberall, and the vviſe, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and pictured as it vvere in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables of this booke? To conclude, hovve notably is the vſe of lots, the force of gifts, the povver of affections, and the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſundrie brutish creatures, therein expreſſed? So many points of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and of ſingular frute, being compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this one litle booke of Salomons Prouerbes, you can not (moſt noble Earle) better beſtovv your labour, then in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating therein both night and day, and in binding the ſentences thereof, as it vvere frontlets before your eyes. Novv to the end that the meaning of theſe diuine ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may be made manifeſt vnto you firſt, and ſo to other into vvhoſe ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds this ſmall treatiſe shall come, I haue tranſlated the text as faithfully as I could, looking into the tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the beſt writers both old and nevve, but eſpecially into the Hebrue copie, ſo farre foorth as my poore talent did enable me and my leiſure ſuffer. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, to the ſame intent and purpoſe, I haue gathered into mine expoſition, the pith and marrovv onely, of all thoſe obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:13294:5"/>vvhich either I had by me of mine ovvne, or receiued from other by vvhoſe conference or vvriting I vvas helped. Finally, (that as much light might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to theſe ſacred Prouerbs as vvel could be for the time by me) in the margent I haue referred the reader to the rootes of diuerſe parables, pointed to ſundrie exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, noted here and there ſome reaſons of the tranſlation, and quoted for proofe or declaration, infinite places of Scripture. All the vvhich paines notvvithſtanding, I confeſſe and acknowvledge, that I am farre from handling of manie points ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, vvhich fault my diſtractions and encumbrances about other neceſſarie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires may excuſe, the vvhich vvere ſo great, as that euen I could not be preſent, to lend anie help to my poore booke vvhen it vvas vnder the preſſe, for the vvhich cauſe I requeſt your Lordship and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous reader, to pardon the eſcapes of the print, and to correct them according to the direction of the printer aftervvard ſet dovvne. But, it may be there vvill be ſome, vnto vvhom this my ſimple com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie
<pb facs="tcp:13294:6"/>vvill ſeeme ſcant large and full inough, but too briefe, and too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. I anſvver vnto theſe, that I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved breuitie of ſet purpoſe, leſt the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume should be too large and too deare, and leſt I in vvriting or other in reading may be ſaid to looſe time. And yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, if the length of a treatiſe be to be iudged not by the number of the vvordes, but by the matters therein contained, this commentarie is in deed verie long. But as concerning large diſcourſes, they are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſermons then for vvritings, and rather to be vſed by thoſe vvho intend to apply ſome frutefull inſtruction, then by thoſe vvhoſe onely drift is to open and cleare hard and darke places of Scripture. Neuertheleſſe againe, to the end that the miſlikers of breuitie, may haue ſomevvhat in this commentarie vvhich may like and pleaſe their humour, I haue ſomevvhat largely handled the foure laſt chapters. Novv if there shal be any, vvho carrying ill vvill or ill minds in them, vvill either not be ſatiſfied vvith a reaſonable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver, or ſeeke to diſgrace my labours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:13294:6"/>they haue an enuious eye, and a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting tongue, I leaue them as vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vncharitable men to their crooked vvayes. Againſt ſuch cauillers and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, your Lordships fauour and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my booke may be no ſmall defence, vnto vvhom I haue dedicated it, not onely for that intent but for diuerſe other, as namely to teſtifie my tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfulneſſe for that honorable curteſie and fauour vvhich I haue found both at your Lordships hands and in the eyes of the tvvo choiſe Ladies, your Aunts, the Counteſſes of VVarvvick and of Cumberland. And againe, in theſe your young and tender years, to direct and guide you the beſt I can in the vvay vvherein you are to vvalke. In deed if you shall receiue this booke onely as a noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay, reioycing in it for a day and then v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it no more, you can reape no frute at all in a maner thereby. But if you shall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time addreſſe your ſelfe thereby, as it vvere by a looking glaſſe, it vvill do you more good then can be ſpoken. For as there is no vice from vvhich it vvill not diſſvvade you, ſo there is no vertue or
<pb facs="tcp:13294:7"/>praiſe, vvhereunto it vvill not moue you. VVhen you shall ſit at a table richly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, it vvill aduiſe you to conſider dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently vvhat is ſet before you.<note place="margin">Pro. 23.1.</note> VVhen you shall be at your pleaſant recreation, it vvil admonish you not to be drovvned therein, nor to loue it aboue meaſure.<note place="margin">Pro. 21.1.</note> VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues and riches shall come in &amp; abound, it vvill put you in minde to honour God vvith your ſubſtance.<note place="margin">Pro. 3.9.</note> VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it shall pleaſe the Lord to lay ſome croſſe vpon you, it vvil exhort you not to refuſe the chaſtice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord.<note place="margin">Pro 3.11.</note> VVhen you shall go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to open your lips to ſpeake of anie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it vvill teach you that vaine talke is not ſeemely in an excellent man or noble perſon.<note place="margin">Pro. 17.7.</note> VVhen you shall ſee the innocent oppreſſed or the poore anie vvay vvron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it vvill ſtirre you vp to deliuer them that are vniuſtly purſued,<note place="margin">Pro. 24.11.</note> and to open your mouth in the cauſe of all the children of deſtruction. To conclude (for it vvould be infinite thus to folovv all the particulars) vvhen you shall haue occaſion to chuſe any ſeruants into your Honorable familie, it vvill direct you to admit and accept thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:13294:7"/>vvhoſe lips are iuſt,<note place="margin">Pro. 16.12.13</note> and vvho ſpeake vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right things, and to reiect thoſe vvho are vvorkers of iniquitie. VVherefore, ſeeing this booke of the Prouerbs of Salomon is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to inſtruct you in euerie good vvay, &amp; to make your Lordship fit to performe eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good vvorke.

For as concerning the ſpeeches of prudence mentioned before in the ſecond verſe, he ſhall be able either to vnderſtand him ſelfe, or to vtter to other,<note place="margin">That theſe foure words are to be diſtinguished, may appeare not onely by the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Hebrewe toung, but by the vſe therof in the ſcripture, as Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacuk. <hi>2.6.</hi> Eccleſ. <hi>12.13.</hi> See the roote of this ſentence Iob <hi>28.29.</hi> That the feare of God is the beginning of wiſedome, is alſo taught Pſal. <hi>111.10.</hi> That inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commeth by it, is alſo affirmed in the <hi>15.</hi> of this booke verſe <hi>33.</hi> Examples of the feare of God wee haue in Noah, Ioſeph, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiues in Egypt. and Cornelius.</note> firſt a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, or a common prouerbe, ſecondly an eloquent ſpeech, or a fine deſcription of a matter: thirdly, <hi>the words of the wiſe,</hi> or choiſe termes, full of Art or eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ſpirit: laſt of all, their <hi>darke ſayings,</hi> or hard and obſcure riddles, which ſhadowe or couer ſome ſecret meaning. Thus then as well the learned as the vnlearned, ſhall be greatly inſtructed &amp; hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by theſe diuine Prouerbes, both in deeds and in words, inaſmuch as hereby they ſhall attaine, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>to wiſedome or inſtruction,</hi> but to the ſpeeches of <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> or of vnderſtanding. But on the contrary ſide, the wicked neither will ſeeke after, neither can be made partakers of theſe vertues or graces, neither ſhall reape any profit by theſe inſtructions, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like vnto them. For as is added in the ſeuenth verſe, <hi>the feare of God which is the beginning of knowledge, of wiſedome, and of inſtruction fooles deſpiſe.</hi> By the feare of God is here meant, not onely that dread of the power of God which reſpecteth ſome trouble or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but that reuerencing of his maieſty wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it commeth to paſſe, that a godly man hath the Lord alwayes before his eyes, highly eſteemeth him, taketh care not to offend him, and is readie in all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13294:11"/>things to obey him. For in regard of his power, he dreadeth him as his Iudge, of his glorie as his king, of his ſtrength as his rocke, of his care as his ſhepherd, of his righteouſneſſe, as his law-giuer, of his mercie as his ſauiour, of his loue as the husband of his ſoule. This reuerence or awe of the Lord, is ſayd to be the beginning or chiefe point of knowledge of wiſedome and of inſtruction, that is to ſay, a principall part or roote thereof, becauſe it not onely preſerueth men from all ſorts of ſinne, but moueth and enableth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to practiſe good workes of euery kind. Now ſeeing the wicked or vngodly people of the world, deſpiſe this beginning or fountaine of Gods graces, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth, or to the wiſedome of the ſpirit, or to the obedience of the word. Thus the elect then come to wiſedome and ſuch other vertues, but the reprobate neuer attaine hereunto, becauſe they either neglect the meanes of their ſaluation, or elſe quench the light or motions of Gods ſpirit, ſo that they want the grace of God through their owne folly, as here is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated when it is ſayd, that fooles deſpiſe the feare of God.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19.</note> That which may be knowne of God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to them, for God hath made it manifeſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but they loue darkneſſe more then light, yea they hate the light becauſe their workes being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, are thereby reproued. Hence it is that they hold the truth of God in vnrighteouſneſſe as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh.</p>

This admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is enforced by a reaſon which is drawne from the reward or frute of obedience. <hi>For they ſhall be a comely ornament vnto thine head, and a chaine vnto thy necke,</hi> that is to ſay, as iewels and gay apparell greatly adorne and ſet out litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo thy parents inſtructions by thee obeyed, ſhal grace and beautifie thine heart and life in ſuch ſort, as that thou ſhalt ſeeme amiable both vnto God and man.

Hereunto to draw him, they not onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the obiection of danger which he might make, remoouing his feare of incurring trouble as well as they can, but promiſe vnto him great gaine, that the hope of a rich bootie, may expell the doubt of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ill ſucceſſe. <hi>If they ſhall ſay come with vs, let vs lye in wayt for blood, let vs freely hide our ſelues againſt the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> Firſt, here the robbers ſhew the yong man, what courſe they meane to take, in ſpoyling trauellers of their goods and liues. They tell him, that they will not openly ſteale or kill, but lurke in ſome buſh or corner to ſuch an intent. They affirme, that they will handle their buſineſſe ſo cloſely, as that they ſhall neuer be called into queſtion, but eſcape ſcotfree. Thus by breeding in him hope of lying hid and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punitie, they go about to bend him to their bow, and to draw him into their companie. <hi>We ſhall ſwallow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp aliue, as the graue, and whole, as they who go down into the pit.</hi> Now the theeues in theſe words declare, how ſure
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13294:12"/>they are to meete with the pray &amp; to auoyd danger. They auouch, ſeeing they be manie and ſo ſtrong, that they will quickly take the paſſengers, bind them faſt inough for making hue and crie after them, and moſt eaſily diſpatch them. For euen as the graue or the pit deſtroyeth and deuoureth thoſe who are put or fall thereinto; ſo (ſay they) we will ſpoile, ſtrip, bind, and quite diſpatch thoſe that come by the high way, leauing them neither life nor any thing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, whereby we may be bewrayed. <hi>Wee ſhall get all precious ſubſtance, we ſhall fill our houſes with ſpoyels.</hi> In theſe wordes, profit is propounded as a lure, to draw the yong man to theft and murder. There is great force in this perſwaſion, ſeeing though a thing be neuer ſo vnlawfull or vnhoneſt, yet if it be gainefull, commonly all ſorts of people greedily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after it. The ſumme of this ſpeech is, as if the robbers had ſayd to the youth, by this courſe which we ſpeake of, we ſhall come to great wealth, meete with a rich bootie, and get ſtore vnto our ſelues of wares, of garments, of ſiluer, of gold and precious iewels.

               <p>From reprouing, Wiſedome commeth to exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. In this verſe, ſhe firſt calleth men to repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and ſecondly promiſeth them great fauor vpon this condition, that they will returne from their wicked wayes.

By the powring out of the ſpirit of wiſedome, a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful beſtowing of the graces of Gods ſpirit is meant.

How true this is may further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by that parable in the Goſpell, wherin is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a great number of thoſe who were bidden to the kingdome of God,<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>22.2.</hi> &amp;c.</note> deſired to be held excuſed, ſome pleading that they had bought a farme, other that they had bought oxen, other that they had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried wiues. Secondly, ſhe obiecteth diſobedience to the aduiſe and reproofes of the word, as alſo to the chaſtiſements of the Lord. For diuerſe alſo there are who are content to heare the word, but they are not amended or reformed by it. How true this is may appeare in thoſe cities of whom mention is made in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Luc. <hi>10.13.</hi> &amp;c.</note> wherin many miracles were wrought, &amp; many good inſtructions taught, but yet they brought not foorth the frutes of repentance. The Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thus ſet the faults of men as it were in order before their eyes, proceedeth to threaten them with grieuous puniſhments and iudgements. <hi>I will alſo laugh at your deſtruction</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and mocke when your feare commeth, &amp;c.</hi> There is not in the Lord any ſuch affection of laughing or mocking as is in man, but when in the courſe of his prouidence he ſo worketh, that he leaueth the wicked in their miſeries, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them a mocking ſtocke to the world, he is ſayd in the Scripture to ſcorne or to haue them in deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,<note place="margin">See Pſal. <hi>2.4.</hi>

               <p>The naughtie woman (a ſecond moſt perillous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill) is herein on the other ſide, moſt liuely painted out in her colours. She is called a ſtrange woman in regard of her condition and diſpoſition, in as much as ſhe ſeeketh to be familiar with many, though in right ſhe appertaineth to ſome one husband. One of her properties is, <hi>to flatter with her lips,</hi> or to make her ſpeeches very ſmooth. For ſhe entiſeth young men to adulterie by wanton words and plauſible perſwaſions, telling them what affection ſhe beareth toward the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what delite they ſhall haue, that her husband is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode and ſo foorth. Another of her qualities is, <hi>to forſake the guide of her youth, and to forget the couenant of her God.</hi> This miſdemenour of hers, argueth her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie and impudencie. For what greater ſhameleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe can there be in a woman, then to caſt away the vale of her eyes, yea to reiect that her husband, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt ſhe choſe and was linked vnto, euen in her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der yeares? Again, what greater vngodlines is there, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to breake that ſolemne promiſe which was made at the times of affiance and mariage, both before God and his Angels and his people? It is a great fault to breake promiſe in a ſmall matter, how much more in the greateſt contract or bargaine that may be? It is a ſpeciall fauor of God to be kept from this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13294:19"/>adultereſſe or harlor. For as is afterward teſtified in this booke, the mouth of a ſtrange woman is a deepe pit, he with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord is angrie ſhall fal therinto. Yea as is affirmed in the eighteenth and nineteenth verſes, her very houſe is infectious and deadly. <hi>For her houſe tendeth to death, and her pathes toward thoſe who are voyd of life.</hi> The place where ſhe keepeth is perillous, yea the very way that leadeth therto is daungerous, for which cauſe thou art not to come neare her habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in any caſe. <hi>Whoſoeuer go vnto her return not backe, neither come vnto the wayes of life.</hi> Whoſoeuer meddle with her are caught in her ſnares, which ſhe layeth not in vaine.

To anſwer briefly vnto this doubt, firſt the promiſes of God touching outward bleſſings are not abſolute or ſimple but conditional. Secondly, the obedience of the godly is not full but in part, and therefore no maruell it is, if in part onely they are made partakers of outward bleſſings.

The ninth verſe is nothing elſe in ſumme, but a repetition or expoſition of that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the Lord in Exodus concerning the paying of firſt frutes and ſuch like oblations to him. For in the foure and thirtith chapter of that booke and the ſixe and twentith verſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith to the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell from the Lord, <hi>bring all the firſt frutes, the firſt frutes of thy land, into the houſe of Iehouah thy God.</hi> Now albeit we are not at this time tyed as the Iſraelites in olde time were, to bring our corne and wine into the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be offred, or beaſts to be ſacrificed, or the firſt borne to be redeemed with a ſumme of money: yet we ought to honor the Lord, by beſtowing our goods on holy vſes, as on the maintenance of the miniſterie and the reliefe of the poore. For this cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Galathians,<note place="margin">

Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, God is not mocked.</hi> Now, wheras here we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted, not onely to honor God with our ſubſtance, but with the firſt frutes, or (as the word alſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) the chiefe of our increaſe: this ſheweth, that it is not inough for vs, when God hath giuen vs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to beſtow onely a litle and that of the worſt of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13294:22"/>our goods on good vſes, no, but we muſt be verie franke and liberall, ſowing plentifully, that alſo we may reape plentifully. Truly, if any be indued with zeale or faith indeed, they will not be ſparing or nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly, but very forward &amp; bountifull in thoſe things, which appertaine to the Lord. An example of the truth hereof we may haue in <hi>Abel:</hi> for whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> affirmeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4.</note> that <hi>Abel</hi> did offer a gift to the Lord of the firſt borne and fatteſt of his flocke, the Apoſtle vnto the Hebrewes plainly teacheth, that he by faith offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a greater ſacrifice to the Lord then <hi>Cain,</hi>

The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which in the tenth verſe is made vnto thoſe who honour the Lord with their goods, importeth thus much, that ſuch ſhall not want in this world or the world to come, but enioy ſtore of all good things. Worldly people commonly think, that if they beſtow much on good vſes, they ſhall go a begging: and, that whatſoeuer goeth that way, is loſt. But here we are taught, that by our liberality toward the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Gods ſeruice, we do not onely not looſe, but gaine much to our ſelues.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13294:24"/>boſome of Iehouah, euen the firſt perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, for ſo this name is taken in this place. The riuer and the fountaine are both of one nature, and when pure water hath bene looked on in the ſtreame, it is a pleaſaunt thing to behold it in the conduict head. Now, Ieſus Chriſt the wiſedome of the Father, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king together with him, is here ſhewed to haue wrought foure excellent workes of wonder. The firſt is, <hi>the founding of the earth,</hi> which being made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and being vpheld by nothing ſaue onely by the power of God, and yet being alſo the mother &amp; pillar of all things, muſt needs be a foundation and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke of ſingular skill and cunning. The ſecond is, <hi>the eſtabliſhing of the heauens,</hi> which declare the glorie of God as the Prophet ſpeaketh. The heate of the ſun, the moiſture of the moone, the influence of the ſtars, the motions of the celeſtiall globes, are manifeſt proofes of vnderſtanding incomprehenſible. If we maruell at the litle clockes which are made by the art of man, how much more may we iuſtly wonder at the skie, the diall of the world? The third is, <hi>the cleauing of the deepes in ſunder.</hi> As the mercie of God appeareth herein, that the earth as a nurſe giueth waters as milke, to quench the thirſt of the creatures: ſo his wiſedome doth no leſſe ſhew it ſelf, in that a paſſage is made in the ground and hardeſt rockes, for ſoft and moyſt waters to pierce through &amp; to riſe vp by.<note place="margin">

Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe then is this reckened among the workes of diuine wiſedome, that <hi>the clouds aboue drop downe the dew,</hi> whereby the withered plants are refreſhed, and the parched earth is cooled.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13294:25"/>vnto thy ſoule, and a grace vnto thy necke.</hi> So, by the word of god &amp; his ſpirit, thou ſhalt be nouriſhed in this life vnto eternall life, yea thou ſhalt alſo be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the ornaments of this life and the life to come, ſhining as a ſtarre on earth and in heauen. <hi>Then ſhalt thou go on thy way ſecurely, and not ſtumble with thy foote.</hi> So, proſpering in thine affaires, thou ſhalt be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the arrow that flyeth by day, neither ſhalt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſuch wickedneſſe or incurre any ſuch danger or trouble, as that thou ſhalt fall, or at the leaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out riſing againe. <hi>If thou ſhalt lye downe thou ſhalt not be afrayd, but whileſt thou reſteſt, thy ſleepe ſhall be ſweet.</hi> So not onely abrode but at home, not onely in the day time but in the night ſeaſon (when troubles moſt ſtir in the heart and enemies practiſe miſchiefe) thou ſhalt be ſafe and without dread or perplexitie of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13294:27"/>vnto them by his ſpirit. <hi>The curſe of God is in the wicked mans houſe, but the dwelling of the righteous is bleſſed.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, God doth plague the houſe of the wicked, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowing their habitations by tempeſts, putting griefe into their hearts, and ſending diſeaſes on them and theirs: but in the meane ſeaſon, he bleſſeth the righteous in their goods, their bodies, their ſoules, &amp; the places wherein they keepe. <hi>Surely, he will ſcorne the ſcorners, but he will geue grace to the humble.</hi> Thirdly, the Lord reſiſteth the proud, croſſing their enterpriſes, ouerthrowing their eſtates, powring on them tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and eternall plagues; but he honoureth the lowly, enduing them with outward bleſſings, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gifts of his ſpirit, &amp; immortall glorie. The truth hereof may appeare in the examples of the builders of the towre of Babel, <hi>Pharao</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> on the one ſide: and in <hi>Abraham, Iob, Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> on the other. Now, they are called lowly, who willingly ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to the Lord, neither refuſe any thing, which either by the word of God, or his prouidence, is impoſed on them. <hi>The wiſe ſhall inherit honor, but ſhame ſhall take away fooles.</hi> Laſt of all, they who are wiſe vnto the Lord and their owne ſaluation, ſhall be aduaunced to account and eſtimation, if not in this life, yet in the world to come, where they ſhall be crowned with euerlaſting glorie: but as for thoſe fooles, who contemne Gods word and follow their owne fancies, the Lord will make them ſpectacles of vengeance &amp; ſhame, either on earth, or at the day of iudgement, in hell. If then the enemies of God may be pitied by the faithfull, for theſe cauſes the godly are rather to take compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on them, then either in regard of their rage to be moued to anie paſſion, or in reſpect of their proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie which laſteth but a while, to follow their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, which ſhall be puniſhed for euer.</p>

               <p>The reaſons before ſet downe tending to diſſwade from adulterie, are in this concluſion of the chapter enlarged by a compariſon betweene the leſſer ſinne and the greater. <hi>A thiefe is not deſpiſed who ſtealeth to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13294:39"/>his ſoule.</hi> Albeit it is a ſhame to ſteale, yet theft is not ſo foule a fault as to defile another mans wife. True it is, he who did ſteale to preſerue his life, was by the law of God to be puniſhed, for he was to make full reſtitution or to be ſold:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.1.</note> but he was not to be put to death or to be noted with publike infamie: at the leaſt when he had made reſtitution, all his diſcredit was to ceaſe. <hi>As for him who commiteth adulterie with a woman &amp;c.</hi> The caſe ſtandeth otherwiſe with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer, who conſidereth not the greatneſſe of his ſinne, or of Gods iudgement againſt it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is voyd of vnderſtanding, for he deſerueth death and by the law of God he is to die. <hi>He ſhall receaue a blow and blame, and his reproch ſhall not be blotted out.</hi> He who committeth adulterie ſhall be purſued by the whoriſh womans husband vnto death, and executed by the magiſtrate, neither onely ſhall he liue and die like a ſtrained and ſpotted man, but euen when he is dead, his infamie ſhall remaine. <hi>For the fierce rage of a man is in iealouſie.</hi> Although effeminate perſons can put vp the wrong offred them in the defiling of their wiues: yet thoſe who haue any manhood in them, will not, neither poſſibly can. Indeed priuat reuenge is vnlawfull, but the ſecret motions of nature will ſo worke in this caſe, that men will purſue thoſe before the magiſtrates euen vnto the death, who haue done them wrong in their chiefeſt treaſures, which are more deare vnto them then life. How true this is, may appeare in the example of that Leuite of whom me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made in the booke of Iudges, who ſeeing his wife to haue bene ſhamefully abuſed, ſent the partes of her dead bodie to the tribes of Iſraell with this meſſage,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Conſider the matter, conſult, and giue ſentence.</hi> To conclude, the husband which is inflamed with iealouſie or rage for wrong offered vnto him in his wife; will neuer be reconciled nor reſt, till he hath bene reuenged of his aduerſarie the adulterer euen
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:13294:39"/>vnto the full. Now if man will not pardon the offence this way done to him, how much more will God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the tranſgreſſion of his law in this caſe, yea how much more ſeuerely will he reuenge ſuch villanie?</p>

               <p>THis Chapter, wherein <hi>Salomon</hi> ſtill intreateth of adulterie, conſiſteth of a Preface contained in theſe verſes, and a parable, which firſt is propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> applied in the reſt of the Chapter. After what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we are to receaue the word of God, the wiſe king ſheweth firſt in theſe ſpeeches, <hi>My ſonne obſerue my wordes &amp;c.</hi> If a man haue iewels he will not caſt them in euery place, but he will keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſafe as he can, vnder locke and key. Such carefulnes would the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt haue vs alſo vſe, in hiding and keeping good inſtructions in our hearts. <hi>Keepe my preceptes and thou ſhalt liue, and my doctrine as the apple of thine eye.</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the word is the ſame to the ſoule, which the eye is to the body. For as the body without the ſight of the eyes, runneth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many things that hurt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:13294:40"/>it, and falleth at euery litle ſtumbling blocke. So the ſoule moſt fearefully ruſheth into ſinnes, if it wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the light and direction of the word. As therefore we are moſt carefull to keepe our eyes from hurt, ſo ſhould we be as charie and warie, to preſerue the admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Scripture. When <hi>Nahaſh</hi> the Ammonit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to make a conenant of peace with the children of Iſraell vpon condition that they would pull out their right eyes, albeit they were in great diſtreſſe, yet would they not yeeld thereunto. In like manner then, let vs not for any thing in the world, part with the good inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which once we haue receaued, yea let vs ſooner part from our eyes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from them. Let vs rather (as is added) <hi>bind them to our fingers, and write them on the tables of our harts,</hi> let vs haue them (I ſay) at our fingers ends, neuer ſuffring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vaniſh or to periſh. To this end euery one is admoniſhed in the laſt place, to ſay <hi>vnto wiſedome thou art my ſiſter &amp;c.</hi> The loue betweene brethren ſiſters and kinsfolke is very naturall, and againe their familiaritie verie great. They often feaſt one another as did <hi>Iobs</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and they liue louingly together as did <hi>Marie, Martha</hi> and <hi>Lazarus.</hi> In like ſort then, we are not to be ſtrangers in the word, but we muſt be dayly conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant therein, louing it moſt dearely and following it moſt carefully. Thus if thou embraceſt and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt prudence, then, ſhe will preſerue thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtrange woman. The ſumme of theſe words is, that for as much as no man by himſelfe is able inough to take heede of the harlot, and the word of God is an onely ſoueraigne preſeruatiue againſt this euill: therefore it is with all diligence to be kept and regarded.</p>

For it doth intreate, not of baſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments but of diuine and rare points, as of election, regeneration, faith, and the glorie which is to come. Secondly, the word of God is vpright. For it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and able to make a man wiſe vnto ſaluation, in it is nothing wanting, nothing vnſound.

Fiftly, the word of God is plaine and eaſie. For albeit the naturall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perceiueth not the things which belong to God, yet the ſpirituall man diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all things. Wherefore if the Goſpell be hid from anie, it is hid from thoſe, whoſe eyes the God of this world hath blinded, that they cannot ſee the truth. Sixtly, the word is alſo profitable, yea more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then gold. For what would it profit a man to win the whole world, &amp; to looſe his ſoule eternally, which by the word of God is ſaued? Laſt of all, the word of God is alſo moſt ſweete and pleaſant. For it reioyceth the heart and ſweeteneth the ſoule like an heauenly kinde of honie. And who would not now rather hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to the royall, vpright, true, iuſt, eaſie, profitable and pleaſant ſpeeches of wiſedome: then the vile, wicked, flattering, impure, ſubtill, and in very deed moſt bitter words of the harlot?</p>

The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this ſpeech is, that God in Chriſt not onely fauoureth or accepteth the iuſt perſon, but that he vſeth to beſtow many benefites on him, as ſignes and tokens of his fatherly good will. Hence it is, that they who walke vprightly, haue oftentimes ſuch wealth, eſtimation, honour and proſperitie in this world.

               </q>
               <p>IN this verſe is declared, that credit or reputation, is a great good thing. <hi>A good name is to be deſired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue great riches.</hi> That glorie or fame which is gotten by well doing, is more excellent then all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world. The reaſons hereof are many and manifeſt. Firſt, a good name maketh the ſpeeches &amp; actions of the perſon in account, acceptable. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a good name remaineth after death. Thirdly, it is a meanes of aduauncing a man oftentimes. Laſt of all, it doth good to a mans children, who for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſake are the more eſteemed and the better hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Some may here obiect, why but doe we not ſee that the wicked are in great reputation? what then, is credit or renowne ſo excellent a thing? Tuſh, the fame of the wicked is onely but a ſhadow of a good name, the roote whereof is vertue onely. It may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be demaunded, if a good name ſpring from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or be ſo great a bleſſing, how falleth it out, that many worthie ſeruaunts of God liue obſcurely and are in no reckening in a manner? God ſeeth obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as well as pouertie to be meete and profitable for ſome of his children. Laſt of all, ſome may thus argue, that if a good name be a moſt pretious iewell, then reproch or infamie wherewith the beſt are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt ſpotted and loaded, is one of the greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils that may be. The anſwere hereunto is ready and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:13294:106"/>eaſie. Ill report deſerued by misbehauiour is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme miſerie, but reproch for well doing is a glorie, which <hi>Moſes</hi> preferred before all the treaſures of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.<note place="margin">

The loue and good liking of men, (alwayes adioyned to the good will of God toward vs) is to be priſed aboue money. For firſt, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s cauſe vſually is ended, as he is friended. Secondly, as we are wont to ſay in our Engliſh Prouerbe, a friend in the Court is better oftentimes then a peny in the purſe. Laſt of all, in warre a man eſcapeth with his life by finding grace in the ſight of his enemie. Hence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that the ſcepter and the ſheepehooke are often ioyned together. To conclude, by this meanes the good of the whole Church of God is ſometimes procured.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The firſt propertie of the wiſe man is, that he ſeeth the euill, to wit by the illightening of Gods ſpirite, which giueth vnto him a ſenſe and feeling of the greatneſſe of ſinne &amp; of the certaintie of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof. Euery one doth not perceiue this, yea
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:13294:106"/>a man may haue all the preceptes of Diuinitie in his heart and in his head, and yet not ſee the daunger of ſinne or of Gods wrath, vnleſſe it be reuealed vnto him by the Lord him ſelfe after a peculiar manner. The ſecond propertie of a prudent man is, vpon the ſenſe of the plague, to force him ſelfe by all lawfull meanes to eſcape. It may here be demaunded, how we are to flye, when we diſcerne the plague to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. The anſwere hereunto is eaſie, that the name of the Lord is a ſtrong towre, the righteous man fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto it and is exalted. Another queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may here be moued, whether it be lawfull to flye euill ayre and places infected with the peſtilence. This doubt may briefly be thus reſolued, that a man may lawfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde any vnneceſſarie daunger or perilous place, whereunto he is not tyed or bound by his calling or charitie. But withall theſe inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that men in the time of the plague are eſpecially to fly to God, that they are to ſhunne ſinne, that they are to take heed of inordinat feare, that they are not to leaue their callings, that they are not to neglect the loue of their brethren by reaſon of a fond and childiſh feare of infection. For hence it commeth to paſſe, that when there is any peſtilence walking in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or countrye not onely ſome ſicke folkes be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to dye away without all keeping, but the women alſo great with child are forſaken in their need, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are left of their brethren, and parents ſhunned by their children. Whereas then it is further added, <hi>that fooles going on are puniſhed,</hi> this is to be vnderſtood of vnneceſſarie daungers or of ſuch plagues, which by ſome meanes they may lawfully auoyd. In which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the ſentence, not onely the blindneſſe but the boldneſſe of carnall men is reproued, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in wicked actions or walke on in daungerous places, without any chaunge of minde or withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the body, vntill they be ouertaken with ſome
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:13294:107"/>calamitie, or ouerthrowen by ſome iudgement of the Lord. For example, the raſh man goeth to euery one that hath the peſtilence or ſome ſuch ſore diſeaſe, &amp; at the laſt he is infected. The gameſter goeth on in his diſing and in the end commeth to pouertie. The robber on the high way ceaſſeth not to folow his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked trade, and at laſt he is apprehended and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The wanton walketh on toward the houſe of the harlot, and in the end he committeth follie with her. To conclude, all ſorts of ſinners ſecurely proceede in their impieties and iniquities, but at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they meete with ſome heauie iudgement of the Lord. Wherefore let euery one pray vnto the Lord, that he may not be ſo brutiſh as to runne into the ſnare which is before him, but that he may haue a quicke ſight to eſpie and foreſee, and a mighty power to ſhunne and eſcape all ſortes of euils which may any wayes hurt him, in goods, in name, in body, or in ſoule.<note place="margin">

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:13294:108"/>out. The ſenſe hereof is, that the idle perſon doth indeede ſo behaue him ſelfe, as if one called to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, ſhould plead that therefore he will not go out of doores, becauſe a Lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in the ſtrets. By the ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuch a one is meant, as deliteth in idleneſſe or loytering. By the Lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abroad, ſome great danger is ſhadowed out. Whereas it is ſaid by the ſluggard, <hi>I ſhall be ſlayne in the ſtreete,</hi> he ſheweth that he feareth, not onely ſome harme, but death it ſelfe. Thus much then here is taught, that although it is not the vſe of idle perſons, to vtter the ſelfe ſame wordes which are ſet downe in this place, yet indeede they alwayes ſo behaue them ſelues, as if they ſpake them. For the ſlouthfull hinder themſelues from their worke, by fainyng of lets and fearing of daungers, as loſſe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, of goods, of libertie, and of life, hauing alwayes one excuſe or other, either in their mouthes, or in their hearts. For, when they are moued or exhorted to follow their trades or to ſerue God, they alledge the hardneſſe, the impoſſibilitie, the trouble, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the matter. Vnto the ſluggiſh perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, watching, faſting, praying is a Lyon. He that is afrayd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his faith or to ſhow his zeale, ſaith often in his heart, I dare not make knowen my Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or declare my loue of the truth, leaſt the perſecutor ſlay me. Thus the ſluggard flyeth ſmal troubles as if they were great, and feareth vncertaine daungers, as if they were certaine. But put the caſe ô ſlouthfull ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that there were a Lyon abroad indeede, yet when thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling bindeth thee to go foorth, thou art to proceede to the workes thereof, ſetting aſide all vayne excuſes and fond feares. Did <hi>Dauid</hi> leaue his fathers ſheepe, becauſe of the Lyon? did <hi>Daniell</hi> ceaſe from praying vnto God, becauſe it was decreed, that he who ſhould ſo do, ſhould be caſt into the Lyons denne? Hath not God made a promiſe to thoſe who walke in their callings, that they ſhall tread vpon Lyons and not be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13294:109"/>hurt? Sluggiſhneſſe then, is in any caſe to be ſhaken off, which cauſeth a man to feare the dangers of this life more then God, yea which oftentimes cauſeth him to imagine that a moule hill is a mountaine, a Lambe a Lyon, an eaſie matter, hard, a ſmall daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, great.</p>

Againſt this golden rule three ſorts of people offend. For example, firſt, they who preferre pleaſure before profit, ſecondly, they, who preferre earthly things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heauenly, laſt of all, they, who preferre ſpirituall things of leſſe neceſſitie or experience for them to deale in, before thoſe ſpirituall matters which are more weightie and more neceſſarie. Of this number are they, who occupie themſelues in priuate exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of religion, when they ſhould bee preſent at the publicke aſſemblies of the Church, as alſo they, who meddle with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies of the church, before they are grounded in the principles of the word. Of the ſecond ſort are they, who more labor after the goods of this world, then the kingdome of God. Of the firſt kind they are, who make great feaſts or beſtow much on their paſtimes or recreations, before they haue a good ſtocke or good commings in. Theſe courſes are all of them prepoſterous, not according to the word, which in all matters willeth vs orderly to proceede, but according to fleſh and blood.</p>

               <p>As the Lord alloweth not the waſtfull ſpender, ſo neither doth he like of the vniuſt and cruell getter of goods. Such are ſaid to get their goods by vſurie and intereſt, who in lending or letting the ſame to hyre, byte and oppreſſe the poore, either by an hard bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or by miſreckoning them. Now it may be theſe cormorantes ſometimes do gather great wealth into their handes, pilling and polling the poore, who ſtand in need of their helpe, and borrow of them after the hardeſt rate. But by the iuſt iudgement of God, ſuch an heire ſhall ſucceed thoſe miſerable oppreſſors, as will lend to the poore, looking for nothing again, and pitie their wantes: for either the children, or the kinſmen, or the friends, or the executors of theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers proue liberall or prodigall perſons oftentimes. Let therfore, as the Apoſtle exhorteth, none oppreſſe or circumuent his brother in any matter, ſeeing the Lord is the reuenger of all theſe thinges. There are many, which cry out againſt vſurie, who are moſt grieuous oppreſſors and vſurers indeed. Some buy of the poore, which are indebted a field very cheap, and ſell it very deare. They are vſurers. Some ſuffer their poore neighbour to fetch much on the ſcore, &amp; then ſet on more then was taken, or make him pay double the worth, of that which he hath fetcht. Theſe are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers. Some get a great deale of bad mony, and paie it away. Theſe alſo are vſurers. Now vſury is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in mony, but in other creatures, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. Giue not vſury to thy brother, vſury of thy mony, vſury of thy meate, vſury of any thing, that is giuen to vſury. As
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:13294:133"/>therefore ſuch as lawfully gaine by monie or other creatures offend not: ſo ſuch, as vnlawfully gaine by corne, wine, or other ſuch marchandiſe, no leſſe are vſurers, then ſuch as abuſe their mony. It may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers here expect ſome large diſcourſe of vſurie, but they may be ſatisfied by the briefe handling of three needful points pertaining to this queſtion. Firſt what is vſurie properly taken, ſecondly why it is vnlawfull, thirdly what is to be thought of the vſuall compacts and dealings of vſurers in theſe times. Vſury proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken is a ſimple binding of the receiuer or borow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of mony or goods to repaie the whole ſumme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and the aduantage thereof agreed on, be it more or leſſe. This ſimple binding or compact is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, firſt, becauſe it is contrary to charitie &amp; equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as may appeare in that it is a thing vnequall, that the ſumme decaying through no negligence, or fault of the receiuer, but by Gods prouidence or ſome caſualtie as by fire and water, hee is bound to ſo great inconuenience, as to make it good. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the Lord hath enacted a law quite contrarie to this dealing, as well touching borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as hyring, the equitie whereof ſtill remaineth as being grounded on Gods will and nature. The law of borrowing is this.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.14.15.</note> 
                  <hi>If any borrow ought of his neighbour and it be hurt, or elſe dye, the owner thereof not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, he ſhall ſurelie make it good: If the owner thereof be by, he ſhall not make it good.</hi> Marke here, the principall in ſuch caſes is not to be required. The law of hiring followeth. <hi>If it were a thing hired, it came for his hire, he ſhall not repay it,</hi> (for that is to be repeated.) Marke here, the vantage may be required, but not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall. Now, this is euident, that in vſurie the thing is lent or hired. By the equitie then of the law of God, to bind both to the principall and to the vantage is a ſinne and vnlawfull. Hereby appeareth that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts now a dayes in vſe are vngodly, yea &amp; that they
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:13294:133"/>are horrible ſinnes, and plaine murderings both of the rich and poore.

Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if the borrower do not, to priſon hee muſt, his wife and children ſtaruing in the meane ſeaſon. And can there be more cutthroat dealing then this? Much more may be ſaid, but it is needleſſe, the ſumme is this, there may be a gaine agreable to charitie in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, in letting, in borrowing and lending, but all vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is vnlawfull, I meane, all ſimple binding and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling of any rich or poore, to repay the principall and the aduantage.</p>

               <p>THe fearefull eſtate of thoſe here is ſhewed, who by no meanes will be reclaimed from their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked waies. In the former part of this ſentence, the ſin of obſtinate perſons is deſcribed, in the latter, their
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:13294:140"/>puniſhment is declared. This is their ſin, that euen as the ſtubborn horſe and brute beaſt will not be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with byt or bridle, but when the yoke is to be put on, reſiſt and with a ſtiffe necke reiect it: ſo obſtinate people, continue in their ſinnes, &amp; grow harder hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted daily, not induring to heare the truth, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their teachers, &amp; fretting againſt the troubles, which the Lord bringeth on them as bridles &amp; yokes to ſubdue and tame their pride and fierceneſſe. Yea though ſuch haue bene told of their faults not once, but an hundred times, and the Lorde himſelfe hath ſchooled them for the ſame by ſickneſſe, infamie, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, and diuerſe croſſes, yet they do ſecurely and boldly proceed in ſwearing, lying, adulterie, murder, theft, and ſuch other vices, perſwading themſelues either that no euill ſhall betide them, or that they ſhall goe through it well inough. The puniſhment, wherewith ſuch obſtinate wretches ſhall be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged is remedileſſe deſtruction. Neither will the Lord be a long time in bringing them to ruine, as they by the ſpace of many daies, moneths or yeares togither refuſed correction, but he in an houre of ſome ſhort ſpace will quite ouerthrow them. Of all other ſinnes then obſtinacie is moſt to be auoyded, ſeeing other tranſgreſſions of all ſorts may finde pardon, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance followeth them, but hardneſſe of hart doth nothing but treaſure vp wrath againſt the day of wrath.

               <p>This ſentence ſheweth,<note place="margin">Tyrannie.</note> that ſuch is the eſtate of the people, as is the diſpoſition of the gouernour. In the former part is affirmed, that when good magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates beare office, howſoeuer ſome wicked raſcals or rebels may be ſorie therefore: yet godlie people, and generally the multitude wil be glad, for they ſhall enioy their liues and goods quietly; by the defence of ſuch, and vnder their rule religion ſhall flouriſh in their congregations, the Lord himſelfe will bleſſe their land with plentie and many good things, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſhall be free from grieuous taxes, plagues, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and many miſeries. The wiſe King who wrote this diuine parable, ſaw in himſelfe the particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of that generall obſeruation, which here he ſetteth downe.<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 1.40</note> For being annointed King ouer <hi>Iſrael</hi> by <hi>Sadock,</hi> the whole people went vp after him play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on pipes and reioycing ſo greatly, that the earth did ring and cleaue (as it were) with their voice. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> his father alſo being aduanced by <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo carried himfelfe in his warres againſt the Philiſtins, that the Iſraelitiſh women moued by his worthie and valiant exploits vnto reioycing, ſung in triumphing wiſe, that <hi>Saul</hi> had ſlaine his thouſands, and <hi>Dauid</hi> his ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes. The latter part of the ſentence declareth on the contrary ſide, that the rule of the wicked, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth matter of griefe and miſerie vnto the whole multitude. The eſtate of the poore people, ouer which fooliſh perſons or cruell perſecutors haue the rule or tyrannize, becommeth lamentable ſundrie waies. Firſt the Lord himſelfe vſually plagueth the land with iudgements from heauen, wherein an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of his, holdeth the ſcepter.

Thirdly, the people liuing without all good order or meanes of their proſperitie, fall daily into all ſorts of ſinnes and pits of deſtruction. Sundry occaſions then of griefe being continually offered the people, through the careleſneſſe or crueltie of euill gouernours, if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture they dare not openly complain for feare of further trouble: yet how can they but ſigh ſecretly in corners? Certainly ſo did the Iſraelites oppreſſed in <hi>Egipt,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> perſecuted by <hi>Achab</hi> and <hi>Iezabell.</hi> Euen as then the welfare of the ſheepe dependeth on the ſhepheard, and euen as ſuch is the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the bodie as is the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the head: ſo the condition of the people anſwereth in wo or wealth, to the goodneſſe or badneſſe of the magiſtrates.</p>

               <p>This drift of the ſpirit in this inſtruction is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that whoredome bringeth beggerie at the laſt. Two ſorts of loue herein are ſpoken of, one ſpirituall, another carnall. The ſpirituall loue is commended, which is a wonderfull liking of and following after wiſedome. Such as are enamoured with this virgin of heauenly wiſedome (which is holy, peaceable, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, full of mercy and good works,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.17.</note> as <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh) ſhall not onely by this meanes pleaſe the Lord, or be profitable vnto themſelues, but comfortable vnto their parents. Sundry waies doth a wiſe ſonne cheare vp his fathers heart. Firſt by the vertues, which are in him. Secondly by the fame, which is ſpread of him. Thirdly by the hope, which his father conceiueth that he wilbe thriftie. Laſt of all, by his liberalitie and kindneſſe towardes his parentes, if peraduenture by reaſon of his gifts, he be at any time exalted to honor
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:13294:142"/>as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was, who alſo in this reſpect reioyced his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As concerning the carnall loue ſpoken of in the latter part of the ſentence, that is condemned and threatned with pouertie. The vaine youthes of this world hauing ſhaken off the yoake of obedience and deſpiſed wiſdome, fall in loue with naughtie women, with whom they are daily conuerſant, making them good cheare, beſtowing gifts on them, and maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them in braue apparrell. Hereby not onely they defile themſelues with wandring luſts, but ſpend their patrimony, &amp; conſume their parents goods, ſo brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſorrow vpon them in ſtead of the ioy, wherewith they ought to labour to comfort them. Such a lewde courſe tooke the prodigall ſonne, who hauing waſted his ſubſtance, was put to feed with the ſwine. Among other reaſons then diſſwading from whoredome, this is not the leaſt to be regarded, that ſtrumpets are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rocks and vnfatiable gulphes.</p>

               <p>Herein againe the holy Ghoſt admoniſheth rulers of their dutie.<note place="margin">Iniuſtice.</note> He entreateth in this verſe of two mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, one, the executing of iudgement, an other, the auoyding of bribes. In the former place is ſhewed that iudgement is the prop or pillar of kingdomes: when iuſtice is miniſtred without partialitie, in ſuch ſort that the godly are rewarded and the wicked pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and euery man hath right done to him, the Lord will bleſſe the lande, the good will loue theyr Prince, the bad ſhall be cut off, and not be able to do any hurt. This may be obſerued throughout the ſtories of the kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that all the while they gaue themſelues to ſet vp true religion, or to puniſh ſinne, their kingdomes were in peace, and they got
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:13294:142"/>the victory ouer their enemies. In the latter part of this ſentence is declared, that the receiuing of bribes is the ouerthrow and bane of a common wealth. The reaſons hereof are manifeſt and ſundry. Firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect perſons (which bribe takers do) is an abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord, and therefore ſuch a tranſgreſſion as pulleth downe his vengeance on the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is committed. Secondly by this meanes no place being left for right but for gifts, there muſt needes grow factions and mutinies. Laſt of all, a window be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet open through ſuch partialitie to hope of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punitie, all ſorts of ſinnes (the plagues of common wealths) muſt needes daily multiply and increaſe.</p>

Hence it commeth to paſſe, that in as much as the plagues of this world or of the world to come commonly moleſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they are in feare, ſorrow, ſilence, ſhame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. <hi>But the iuſt man ſingeth and is merry.</hi> There is none ſo righteous as that hee is without ſin, but ſuch are called iuſt heere, who are iuſtified by faith in Chriſt, and ſanctified in ſome acceptable meaſure by the ſpirit.

Indeed none are more in afflictions then they, but they are ſo farre off from mourning in this reſpect, that they count it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding when they fall into manifold trials.

               <p>Negligence in iudging or determining caſes in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:13294:143"/>controuerſies, herein is condemned. By knowing of a perſon or cauſe, oftentimes in the Scripture the protecting, fauouring, and furthering thereof is meant. Thus the Lord is ſaid to know the way of the righteous, and to know thoſe, who are his, that is, to fauour them, and to take care for them. Here then is meant, that although the poore man hath no money to giue bribes, or wealthie friends to take his part: yet the godly man diſcerning his cauſe to be right, by all meanes and with all paines defendeth it againſt the rage of the mightie aduerſarie. Such an vpright iudge was <hi>Iob,</hi> who proteſteth that in the dayes of his proſperitie and authoritie he was <hi>a father to the poore,</hi>

The hurt which they do, is like the hurt of fire, yea much greater then it. For they ouerthrow Religion, peace, concord of neighbours and loue of friends.

Two meanes commonly are vſed by the godly and prudent ſeruants of God, vnto the reclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of fooles (by whom proud, wrathfull, ſtubburne, ignorant and wicked perſons here are meant) from their follie and madneſſe. The former of theſe is, to be <hi>moued,</hi> as here <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh, that is to ſay, to be in good ſadneſſe, to deale earneſtly, to looke with a ſterne and auſtere countenance, to alledge weightie reaſons, or to vſe forcible ſpeeches of perſwaſion and round repreſhenſion. The Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> calleth this
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:13294:144"/>manner of dealing a comming vnto offenders with the rod. The other meanes is ſmiling, or as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaketh, the ſpirit of mildneſſe, that is to ſay, humble entreatie, faire ſpeeches and friendly lookes, tokens of good will, common or ſpeciall curteſies, and ſuch like gentle meanes of winning mens hearts. Let now a godly or peaceable perſon come to inſtruct or pacifie a froward or wilfull foole, he laboureth in vayne.

This admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tendeth to ſtir vp parents to traine vp their children in the feare and nurture of the Lord. In the former part of it a bleſſing is promiſed vnto diſcreet and moderate cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. <hi>The rodde,</hi> that is to ſay, ſtripes, when occaſion ſhall require beſtowed on a childe, <hi>and a reproofe,</hi> that is, a rebuke by words, <hi>giue wiſedome,</hi> that is to ſay, make him modeſt, dutiful, religious, and a practiſer of Gods commandements. For indeed true wiſedome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not in learning, or knowledge of worldly or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall matters, but in practiſing the law of God with a conſcience. This frute of correction as it is preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in it ſelfe: ſo it muſt needs be comfortable to the parents of that child in whom it is. For as before hath bene affirmed, <hi>A wiſe ſonne maketh a glad father.</hi> But as it followeth in the latter end of this ſentence. <hi>A childe or boy left to himſelfe ſhameth his mother.</hi> Then a boy is
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:13294:147"/>left to himſelfe, when he is neither chaſtened with the rod, nor controlled by words, but cockered, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doniah</hi> was by <hi>Dauid.</hi> This fault is often to be found in fathers, but yet commonly it moſt of all raigneth in mothers, who if they haue ſonnes, eſpecially, cannot abide that in their tender age they ſhould be ſpoken to, or ſharply dealt withall. For this cauſe here the holy Ghoſt eſpecially directeth his ſpeech to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and threateneth them. It is then a fault in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, onely to vſe admonitions, and not therewithall corrections, which are neceſſary, or to neglect both the one and the other meanes of bringing their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to amendment. <hi>What childe is it</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>whom the father correcteth not?</hi> Cockering parents will ſay, if ſo they do, they ſhall make their children fooliſh, but here a promiſe is made of the contrary, namely that they ſhal make them wiſe. But this point hath bene entreated of before, in the 22.15. and 13.24. and 23.13.14. Onely thus much may here be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that ſuch as at Gods commandement wil not correct their children with the rodde, would hardly with <hi>Abraham</hi> take the knife, to ſlay them, if the Lord ſhould enioyne this for their triall.</p>

Hereby it commeth to paſſe, that wicked perſons encreaſing in age, in number, in power, encreaſe in ſinne alſo, being not babes in malitiouſneſſe, but growing to the top of all impietie and iniquitie.

At the beginning of the doctrine of the Goſpell, the Iewes were ſomewhat pliable, and the moſt obſtinate of them, raged not ſo much as at the laſt they did againſt our Sauiour.

               <p>This point hath oft bene handled, as namely in the 22. Chapter of this booke and the 15. verſe, alſo in the 28. Chapter and the 17. verſe.

               <p>We are herein taught to be farre off from commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with ſinners, as to rebuke and reproue thoſe offences, whereunto we are priuie. All men general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly count it a wicked thing to ſteale, and many, who are
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:13294:151"/>euen without all feare of God, will not rob or pilfer themſelues, but a great number make no bones to be acceſſary vnto euill doers, and are glad when they may haue any ſhare in a rich bootie manfully gotten. Howſoeuer ſuch may thinke themſelues to be better then theeues: yet the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> maketh them all one with them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay.</hi> 1.</note> when he ſaith, thy Princes are the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of theeues. Now here is ſhewed that not onely theſe partakers with euill doers are in fault, as well as they, but that they ſhall not eſcape puniſhment. For thus much is meant when it is ſaid, that they hate their owne ſoule or them ſelues, that is to ſay, they make them ſelues ſubiect to danger of law, to infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and to the wrath of God, in as much as theeues and robbers ſhall not inherite the kingdome of God.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> The Lord by his Prophet threatneth ſuch, affirming, that in as much as they ſaw a theef,<note place="margin">

This to be the naturall ſenſe of theſe words may appeare by that mother ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vnto which this verſe is referred, which is ſet downe in the fift Chapter of Leuiticus 1. verſe. <hi>Alſo when one hath ſinned and he hath heard the ſinne of blaſphemie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he is witneſſe whether he hath ſeen it, or whether he hath heard it, if he tell it not, ſurelie he ſhall beare his iniquitie.</hi> In which place as appeareth by the ſute of the whole Chapter,<note place="margin">Thus Tremellius and Iunius alſo take it.</note> the Lord ſpeaketh not of publicke but of priuate offences, and not of accuſations brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Magiſtrates, but of priuate admonitions. Many a
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:13294:151"/>one, who heareth his neighbour vſe moſt execrable ſpeeches, herein thinketh him highly to offend, and is ready in heart to condemne him. But although he let him proceed, or open not his mouth at all to declare his fault vnto him: yet he blameth not himſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth not or doth not conſider, that his ſuffering of his neighbours ſinnes to paſſe without any controlment vſed by him, maketh him ſubiect to the puniſhment due thereunto.

               <p>As in the verſe going before, the effects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating in ſinne or winking thereat, haue bene ſhewed: ſo in this the contrary workings of infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and faith are declared. The ſpirituall feare and ſonlike reuerence of God, is a fountaine of life, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this booke hath bene affirmed. Againe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall feare of dangers, of troubles, &amp; of death is not to be reproued, ſo long as it keepeth in compaſſe, or is ſanctified by the ſpirit of God. But here a ſlauiſh &amp; helliſh feare is ſpoken off, ſpringing from infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and troubling the mind aboue meaſure, with the dangers or euils of this life or the world to come. This feare worketh a ſnare, euen death and deſtruction, euen as the Apoſtle ſaith, the ſorrow of this world
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:13294:152"/>doth. For firſt, he which feareth the faces of men or troubles, runneth by this meanes into many ſinnes, as to leaue his calling, to truſt in carnall helpes, and to deny the truth of God. Secondly, he giueth the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries great aduantage ouer him, whom by reaſon of his feare, he is not able to reſiſt, and who on this occaſion are emboldened. Thirdly, by extreeme paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons his ſenſes are bound, his ſpirits dulled, his bodie caſt into diſeaſes, and his minde faileth and fainteth. Laſt of all, in as much as he doubteth of the fauour of God, by this meanes hee doth incurre eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſeeing the featfull ſhall haue their portion in the lake, which burneth with fire and brimſtone. As then the fearfull beaſts and byrds fall into pittes, and inwrap themſelues in ſnares: in like ſort the timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perſons draw the iudgements of the Lord vpon themſelues. There are a great number in the world, which are farre from this feare, and yet no nearer to happineſſe, if not further off from it then the timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. For they feare neither God nor man, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption embraceth their neckes as a chaine. Their deſtenie hath before bene ſet downe, that they ſhall fall into euill. <hi>But he, which truſteth in the Lord, is placed on high.</hi> The perſon, which is ſecure of the good will of God, which conſtantly ſuffereth afflictions, and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly as a fouldier of Chriſt, proceedeth in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Pſal. 92.</note> ſhall be ſafe and ſure vnder the Lords defence, in as much as he will be as a rocke, as a tower, and as a caſtle vnto him. For firſt, nothing ſhall touch ſuch a one to do him hurt. Secondly, the Lord euen in this world will oftentimes preſerue him, as may appeare in the 11. Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes. Laſt of all, his ſoule after death, ſhal mount vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as to a fenced citie. <hi>David, Daniell</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> may be witneſſes of the truth of this doctrine.</p>

               <p>IN theſe verſes we are to obſerue, firſt the title, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly ſundry inſtructions. In the title we are to note the author of the parables following, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of them, the firſt meanes of publiſhing them, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally a certaine perſon or perſons concerning them, or whom they concerne. The author of them was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iaketh,</hi> whoſe name elſewhere in the Scripture is not recorded, but by his prouerbes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that he was a man indued with rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge. Some thinke that <hi>Salomon</hi> is here called <hi>Agur,</hi> but it appeareth that they are deceiued, ſeeing <hi>Agur,</hi> is here plainly affirmed to haue bene the ſonne of <hi>Iaketh,</hi> but it is manifeſt that <hi>Salomon</hi> was the ſon of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Moreouer ſeeing the author of theſe ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences ſheweth in the 7. verſe that he made a petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither to haue much riches nor to be extremelie poore, it is euident that he was not <hi>Salomon,</hi> whom God called to a kingdome, and greatly enriched with all ſtore of ſubſtance. Neuertheleſſe, albeit <hi>Agur</hi> was not <hi>Salomon:</hi> yet the ſpirit, which was in <hi>Salomon,</hi> was in him, yea the ſame gift of ſpeaking by darke ſayings being beſtowed on him, made him in the ſame kinde with <hi>Salomon,</hi> to be profitable vnto the Church of God. As for the authoritie of this booke, it may be gathered hence, that it is termed an abſtract of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs</hi> ſentences, or as the Hebrew word doth alſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, <hi>apropheſie.</hi> For herein thus much is inſinuated, that the ſpirit of God allowed of them, firſt inſpiring <hi>Agur,</hi> ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly mouing the penners of this treatiſe to ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> down in that order, wherein now we haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As touching the meanes of publiſhing theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, this was done by <hi>Agur</hi> him ſelfe, and at the firſt not by writing, but by word of mouth. For it is not ſaid, the writings, which he pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, but the words which that (excellent) man ſpake. Euen as then <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> vpon occaſions vttered parables, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward were written: ſo did <hi>Agur.</hi> Finally, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:13294:154"/>the perſons here named <hi>I thiell</hi> &amp; <hi>V call,</hi> whether theſe wordes are the names of the Scribes, by whom this treatiſe was copied, or whether the friends of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur</hi> were ſo called, to whom theſe ſayings were vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or whether the ſonne of God is noted by theſe titles, of whom chiefly the inſtructions following en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, or whether <hi>Agur</hi> ſpeaking of the father of lights, ſaith, <hi>by I thiell,</hi> that is, <hi>God with me,</hi> and <hi>Vcall,</hi> or <hi>Ve-ucall, I ſhalbe able:</hi> (after which ſort <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh of the grace of God with him, and ſaith that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do all things through Chriſt, who maketh him ſtrong) the matter is not great, and it commeth all to one purpoſe, for <hi>Paule</hi> planteth, and <hi>Apollos</hi> wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, but God giueth the increaſe. <hi>Paule</hi> is nothing and <hi>Apollos</hi> is nothing, but God is all in all. Let vs learne not ſo much curiouſly to inquire after, as wiſely to profit by the names and helpes of excellent perſons, albeit not throughly knowen vnto vs. This doctrine <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth the Corinthians, when he ſaith, <hi>whether any aske the queſtion concerning Titus, be is my fellow, and fellow helper vnto you, whether of the brethren, they are the meſſengers of the Churches, &amp; the glorie of Chriſt. Therefore ſhew the declaration of your loue, and of our boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of you, in the ſight of the Churches.</hi> Thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the title. Now as concerning the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we are therin alſo to obſerue foure points, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt is, that the author thereof did not know holy things by the light of nature, the ſecond, that this is true knowledge to know God the father, and his ſonne Chriſt, the third, that the word of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meanes of this heauenly knowledge is moſt pure, the laſt, that this word is to be beleeued and ſincerely obeyed. When as <hi>Agur</hi> ſaith, <hi>I haue bene brutiſh, ſince I haue bene a man, and there is not the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of a man in me,</hi> he plainly confeſſeth, and openly proclaimeth, that of him ſelfe he is voyde of ſauing knowledge. For he which ſpeaketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:13294:154"/>this ſort of him ſelfe, declareth, that he wanteth his reaſon, and common ſenſe in ſpirituall things. And certainlie (as <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſpeaking more generally witneſſeth) <hi>Euery man</hi> (naturally) <hi>is more brutiſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ierem.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>then that he can perceiue, for the naturall man perceiueth not the things which belong to God, yea the oxe knoweth his owner,</hi>

                  <hi>and the aſſe his crib, but I ſraell hath no knowledge, and the people of God no vnderſtanding.</hi> Were it poſſible that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters ſhould be ſo blockiſh as they are, to kneele down to a peece of wood or of ſtone, vnles they were by nature brutiſh? As concerning the ſecond point, the queſtion is demaunded, <hi>what his name is, who aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpinto heauen, and deſcended, &amp;c. and what is his ſonnes name?</hi> The anſwere vnto the former queſtion is that it is not any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or creature, but the true God, onely wiſe, onely mercifull, and onely iuſt, who onely doth theſe actions, as may appeare in that they are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto him. <hi>Amos.</hi> 9. Pſal 104, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 40. <hi>Iob.</hi> 38. For firſt he by his effectes aſcended and deſcended,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.1.</note> perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting both heauen and earth and all their hoſts at the beginning of the world, neither doth he ſtill ceaſe working in theſe places.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.</note> Indeede our Sauiour after a ſpeciall manner aſcended into heauen and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but here thoſe workes are meant, and mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which the father worketh in common with him, as the mouing of the ſunne and the ſtarres,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos.</hi> 9.</note> and as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> ſpeaketh, the building of his vpper chambers in heauen, &amp; the founding of his armies vpon the earth. Againe God holdeth the winds in his fiſt. There are no members of a body in the Lord, but theſe things by a borrowed ſpeech are aſcribed to him, to ſhew that there is ſome what like in regard of his effectes. Euen as then he, which holdeth any thing in his fiſt, hath full power ouer it to diſpoſe thereof: ſo God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the winds, and ruleth ouer the element of the aire. Therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.</note> that <hi>the Lord maketh the lightning and raine, and bringeth the wind out of his treaſures.</hi>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:13294:155"/>Furthermore the Lord bindeth the waters in his cloke, for as men vſe to wrap vp things which they will carrie, and to tye vp looſe trinkers in cloths and clouts: ſo the Lord incloſeth the waters, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them about with his decree, with the bankes of the earth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 38.</note> &amp; with the clouds, which in this reſpect <hi>Iob</hi> calleth the Lords bottels. The waters at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were gathered by the Lord into one place, and now the ſea is wrapped as it were in ſwaddling bands as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh. To conclude, the Lord eſtabliſheth the boundes of the earth, euen as a cunning builder of an houſe. For at the beginning he ſaid, <hi>let the drie land appeare,</hi> and now he ſo preſerueth the earth by the word of his power, that it remaineth ſtill firme and vnmoueable. But the name of this true God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be knowen aright, vnleſſe alſo we know his ſonnes name, and therfore the queſtion is demaunded, <hi>what is his ſonnes name, if thou canſt tell?</hi> The anſwere hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is, that his name is wonderfull, counſeller, the Prince of peace, God manifeſted in the fleſh, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in the ſpirit, coëternall, coëquall, coëſſentiall with the father, he alſo who aſcended and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Now then let vs know the ſonne of God, and we ſhall know the true God. For he is the angell in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods name is written, he is the grauen image of his glorie. Therfore our Sauiour ſaith to his Apoſtles. <hi>If ye had knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.</note> 
                  <hi>ye had alſo knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my father.</hi> Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſumme of this diuine doctrine is that which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down, <hi>this is eternall life, to know thee to be the only true God, and who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt ſent Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> But as touching the word of God, which ſheweth theſe miſteries, it is ſaid, that <hi>the whole word of God is moſt perfectly puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> Albeit none by nature can perceiue the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med myſteries: yet by the word of God they may be vnderſtood in ſome ſort, &amp; in ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Romanes, <hi>Say not in thine heart, who ſhall go vp into heauen, for the word is neare
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:13294:155"/>in thy mouth and in thine heart.</hi> And euery part of this word is pure, both the preceptes and the promiſes, the ſtories and propheſies, finally, the law &amp; the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Nay it hath bene purified as the ſiluer in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pot moſt perfectly. For what iotte or title of Gods word euer fell to the ground? What did God euer ſay, which came not to paſſe? Yea <hi>Abraham</hi> found it true, euen when he was about to ſlaie <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Iſraelites tried the truth of it in the firie furnace of <hi>Aegipt, Dauid</hi> had periſhed in his afflictions but for it. Philoſophie is vaine, mens words are full of deceit, fleſh and blood is fantaſticall, but the word neuer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth, neuer faileth any that laie hold on it. God therefore the authour of this word is to be beleeued, who, as is added is <hi>a buckler to thoſe, who betake themſelues vnto him.</hi> God therefore giueth vs his word, that faith thereby being wrought in vs, we ſhould flie to him for helpe, which doing, we ſhall be preſerued from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, from euill men, yea from ſinne and Satan, by his mightie power: for the Lord is not onely a light, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh, that is a giuer of good things, but a buckler, that is a preſeruer of vs from euill. Sorrow ſticketh in vs, trouble is on vs, temptations ceaſe not to aſſault vs. Satan preuaileth againſt vs, becauſe we flie not to the name of God as wee ought. But the word of God muſt alſo ſincerely be obeyed. <hi>Adde not to his words, that he do not reproue thee, and thou become a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> To ſearch out with modeſtie, or to deliuer truly the ſenſe of the ſcripture, is not to adde thereunto, but to conſent vnto it. But they are ſaid to adde to the word, who infect the puritie thereof, or ſay or do any thing contrary thereunto. Such adders vnto the word, were in old time the Scribes &amp; Phariſies, who taught for doctrines the traditions of men. <hi>Saul</hi> alſo when he ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> added his owne carnall reaſon to the commandement of God. <hi>Agur</hi> diſſwadeth from adding to the word of God, by a reaſon taken from
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:13294:156"/>the puniſhment, which the Lord vſeth to bring on thoſe, who this way offend. The Lord threatneth in the Reuelation, that he will adde vnto ſuch the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments written in that booke. For this ſinne <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were conſumed with fire from heauen, and <hi>Vzzah</hi> periſhed moſt fearefully. Laſt of all, the greatneſſe of this ſinne is ſhewed to the end it may be auoyded. <hi>Leſt thou be found a liar.</hi> To belie men were a great offence, how much more then to be found a falſe witneſſe concerning God? It is treaſon to falſifie and corrupt the Princes coine and image, what high treaſon muſt it needs be then, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit or corrupt the pure word of God? Let vs learne here to be content with the ſimplicitie of the word in all things, not adding our owne inuentions or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, nor purſuing togither with it our profits and pleaſures.</p>

               <p>Theſe verſes containe a praier, which <hi>Agur</hi> made, and an admonition which he gaue. In the praier we are to obſerue the preface, which he vſeth to the lord before it, and the matter of it. The preface is this, <hi>Two things I requeſt of thee, forbid them not from me, whilſt I liue.</hi> There is no doubt but that <hi>Agur</hi> deſired euen a thouſand things at Gods hands, for he ſtood in need
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:13294:156"/>of ſo many neceſſaries, yea and of infinit more, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we all do. But he begged two things principally &amp; particularly as moſt needfull for him, in regard of glorifying God, and his owne good. Let vs learne by his example to looke before we come to pray, what we ſtand in need off eſpecially, and to conſider what ſutes we will put vp to the Lord. Now as concerning the time, wherein he deſireth to enioy the things for which he praieth, it is ſo long as he ſhould liue, not for a day, or moneth, or yeare onely. Hee doth then craue (as it were) not a leaſe, but a fee ſimple of the Lords benefits. So doth <hi>Dauid,</hi> when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>One thing haue I intreated of Iehouah, that I will requeſt, euen that I may remaine, in the houſe of I ehouah, all the daies of my life.</hi> The matter of the praier conſiſteth of certain ſutes, and of certaine reaſons of thoſe ſutes. The ſutes are of two ſorts, as firſt for the graces deſired, ſecondly for the meanes, whereby thoſe graces may be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. One of the graces is, <hi>Remoue farre from me vanitie,</hi> that is to ſay, let not pride, vnthankfulneſſe, worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or idolatrie, or ſuch like vanities of this world, take hold on me at anie time. The prophet in the pſalme affirmeth this to be one of the properties of a citizen of heauen,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.</note> 
                  <hi>That he lifteth not vp his ſoule vnto vanitie.</hi> Certainly it is a verie hard thing not to truſt in riches, or not to delight in this world aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and therfore we are no leſſe earneſtly then <hi>Agur</hi> did, to ſue for this holy grace. The other grace by him requeſted is, <hi>That a falſe matter or a lying ſpeech, may be remoued from him,</hi> that is to ſay all vnfaithfull dealing, craft, forgerie, couſenage, periurie &amp; hipocriſie. The prophet in the pſalme in like ſort, ioyneth both theſe togither when he ſaith, <hi>How long will ye loue vanitie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſeeke after leaſing?</hi> This is a ſpecial and a rare grace, as may appeare in that all eſtates of people in all places almoſt, are giuen to diſſimulation.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.</note> The Apoſtle wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs to put away lying, but before we can ſo do, we
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:13294:157"/>muſt pray that the Lord would remoue it farre from vs. Now as concerning the meanes of attaining to theſe two graces, <hi>Agur</hi> in the former place reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, that he may not haue too litle, ſaying, <hi>Giue me not pouertie,</hi> that is to ſay, ſuffer me not throughout my life to be in extreme want, as not to haue food and raiment, or the neceſſaries of this life. It may be thought by ſome, that this deſire to auoyd extreme penurie in <hi>Agur,</hi> was not lawfull. For was not <hi>Lazarus</hi> exceedingly poore, and yet the ſeruant of God, and not driuen by his want to vnfaithfull dealing? Again, was not <hi>Paul</hi> needie oftentimes, and yet walked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, becauſe he knew how to want, and how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound? Rather as it may ſeeme, <hi>Agur</hi> was to pray for that gift, which <hi>Paul</hi> had, then that he ſhould not be ſo extremely poore. But in as much as <hi>Agur</hi> doth not abhorre pouertie ſimply, or otherwiſe, then for the danger of ſinning, which it bringeth men often vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and might caſt him into, and for the obtaining of truth and plaine dealing: his heart being rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the praier which he maketh to this entent is holie, and was acceptable no doubt vnto God. In this ſort to the ende we may glorifie God the better, we may pray againſt ſickneſſe and aduerſaries, &amp; wants, including alwaies this condition as he did, (to wit if God ſaw it good for him) and to this effect, that we be neuer tried aboue that, which we ſhall be able to beare. In the next place, <hi>Agur</hi> praieth and ſaith, <hi>Giue me not viches, feed me with the food of mine allowance.</hi> A ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God (as appeareth in <hi>Abraham, Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi>) may haue riches, and yet performe his dutie. <hi>Agur</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſimply praieth not againſt wealth, or altogither condemneth riches, but he requeſteth that he may haue the food of his allowance, that is the daily portion which God hath cut out for him in his decree to the ſupplying of his wants,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lue.</hi> 11.</note> and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of him in his ſeruice, be it neuer ſo meane,

Thus to pray againſt abundance, is as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as when we come to a table well furniſhed, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the Lord that we may take ſo much of the food ſet before vs, as may ſtrengthen our bodie, and make our ſoules more fit to his ſeruice, and not cramme in more, then wil do vs good, or ſo much as will oppreſſe our hearts. As concerning the reaſons of <hi>Agurs</hi> prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, one of them is, <hi>Leſt being filled I lie and ſay, who is the Lord?</hi> Although riches in themſelues moue not men, nor bring them to forget or blaſpheme God, yet when vanitie is not remoued from the rich poſſeſſors thereof, ſuch effects do alway follow, and therefore <hi>Agur</hi> here ſheweth, that he made his former praier not without iuſt cauſe, and to an holie end.

For foure ſorts of ſuch wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons are in theſe verſes rehearſed and noted. By the which number of foure, the wiſe <hi>Agur</hi> in the doctrine following, goeth about to teach vs manie profitable leſſons. The firſt of theſe euill ſtocks or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations and kinreds are thoſe, <hi>Which curſe their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bleſſe not their mother:</hi> that is (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh to <hi>Timothie</hi>) <hi>who are diſobedient vnto parents,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.</note> yea and ſo vndutifull and vngratious, that they wiſh their euill, reproch them with contemptuous ſpeeches, and in the pride of their hearts riſe vp againſt them. A di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine curſe pronounced by thoſe, who are called ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the Lord, and vpon iuſt cauſe vttered, is no ſinne at all, yea it is a dutie ſomtimes, albeit ſeldome to be practiſed. But thoſe diuelliſh execrations, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by without cauſe or a calling, euil is wiſhed to any, or anie is reuiled, are alwaies grieuous and hainous crimes, notwithſtanding that they be onely bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe, that be of the loweſt and baſeſt conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now then, when as children ſhall ſpit out ſuch poiſon againſt thoſe, who beare the Lordes perſon, who are the authors and preſeruers of their life, what greater degree of impietie can they come vnto? And as childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s curſing of their natural parents is a great offence: ſo is the rebellion of any inferiors, againſt their ſuperiors. Let then euerie one take heed that he be not of the number of thoſe, who reſiſt or ſpeake euil of ſuch, as God hath placed ouer them. Let none be offended, if ſuch there are in theſe times. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, let parents ſo traine vp their children, that they
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:13294:159"/>may be reuerent and obedient vnto them. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond generation is of thoſe, who are cleane in their owne eies, although they haue not bene waſhed from their filthineſſe. Theſe here ſpoken off, are hipocrits, who either being blind with ignorance, ſee not their errors &amp; iniquities: or elſe by reaſon of malice, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not that they do amiſſe. For although they do continue in the filthineſſe of their tranſgreſſions: yet notwithſtanding they thinke that they are in a good eſtate. Of this ſort are the Papiſts, who worſhip idols, and teach damnable doctrines, and yet boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be the Catholike Church. Likewiſe they which call euill good, as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh, and good euil, iuſtifying themſelues in their prophaning of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, their ſwearing, and their groſſe euill actions, and falſe opinions, as if all were well.

                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</note> The third ſtocke or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred as it were, is of thoſe, <hi>Whoſe eyes are hautie, &amp; whoſe eye lids lift vp themſelues.</hi> The proud people of the world are here noted by the ſignes of arrogancie, to wit, the caſting of the eye vpward, to behold high and loftie things, and the lifting vp of the eye lids vnto the ſame entent and purpoſe. For the eye is as it were the ſtar of the forehead, and the glaſſe of the minde. Looke what affections are in the heart, they are eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by the eye.

But euen theſe at one time or other, by one ſigne of pride or other, will plainly bewray the hauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their ſpirits. For firſt they, that are proud of their wealth and ſuch outward things, will manifeſt their lofty mindes, either by coy lookes or diſdainful ſpeeches, or affecting the higher places, as did the Phariſies.

Finally euen they which haue receiued no gifts at all, but by reaſon of a pride in the heart, deſpiſe their neighbours and rebell againſt God, may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned oftentimes by their poyſoned malice, &amp; vayne behauiour, as toades by their ſwelling, and bladders by the puffing of them vp with wind. The fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is of thoſe, <hi>whoſe teeth are ſwords, and whoſe cheek-teeth are kniues, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume the poore out of the earth, and the needie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among men.</hi> Cruell oppreſſors are noted by this laſt ſtocke or kindred, who are ſhewed to deſtroy the poore by their accuſations, tyrannie, ſtrength &amp; wicked dealings, euen as beares, or lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or wolues, &amp; ſuch beaſts, who hauing ſharpe and ſtrong teeth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the ſilly ſheepe and lambes.

The nature of the things them ſelues further may induce vs thus to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this place. For firſt the graue in the Hebrew tongue hath his name of crauing, and it is as it were a mouth, which neuer being filled, alwayes crieth no hoe. <hi>Habakuk</hi> ſpeaking of the vnſatiable couetouſneſſe of the Babilonian expreſſeth it by this compariſon of the graue, ſaying, that <hi>he enlargeth his ſoule as the graue,</hi>

It pleaſeth the Lord to lay vpon ſome the croſſe of barrenneſſe, ſo that they haue no childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which may reſemble them, or beare their names, or be their heires. Theſe commonly take their eſtate heauilie, and as wonderfully in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they are caſt down, ſo infinit is the deſire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they couet ſo great a bleſſing.

In the former part of this ſentence, the fault of diſobedient children is declared, which is, that they ſcorne their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes and deſpiſe them. They are ſo farre from honouring them, that they laugh at their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, tranſgreſſe their commandements, ſtrike them, or curſe them, or vſe ſome like miſdemeanour toward them. Examples of this diſobedience we haue in <hi>Eſau, Cham, Abſolom,</hi> and <hi>Adoniah,</hi> and <hi>Iſmael.</hi> In the latter place the puniſhment is ſhewed, which ſhal fall on ſuch rebels, their eyes ſhall be pickt out, and eaten vp, that is, they ſhall be put to death, yea an infamous death, according as the Lord willeth in Ex. 21.17. For by the eye which is a part of the bodie moſt deare, the whole perſon is meant, and by the digging out ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the vengeance, which ſhall fall on the perſon, is noted. But moreouer the rauens ſhall dig out their eye, or the young eagles eat it vp.

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:13294:162"/>be reuenged and plagued.

                  <hi>Agur</hi> in theſe verſes hauing relation to the ſecond generation before ſpoken of, by three ſimilitudes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that adulterers and adultereſſes ſo cunningly couer their folly, for the moſt part, as that hardly or not at all they can be eſpied or conuinced. When as the eagle flieth in the aire, ſhe ſo ſwiftly paſſeth out of one place into another, that no ſign of her paſſage can poſſibly be diſcerned. Againe, when as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent crawleth on a rocke, or ſtone, he ſlideth away ſo quickly and ſmoothly, that no print of his bodie, or
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:13294:162"/>proportion of any part thereof doth remaine. Finally when as the waters haue come together in the place, where a ſhip hath ſailed, no monument or note of the paſſage of it doth any where appeare. In like ſort, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterers &amp; adultereſſes ſo cunningly diſſemble their wickedneſſe, as that notwithſtanding they continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commit folly, yet they are not ſuſpected, nor can be conuinced of vnchaſtitie. <hi>Dauid</hi> ſo coloured his wicked way with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> by going about to make <hi>Vriah</hi> drunke, and by cauſing him to be ſlaine, as that euen the way of a Serpent on a rocke might aſſoone haue bene traced out, as it. So likewiſe <hi>Potiphers</hi> wife couered her wantonneſſe with ſuch cunning, as that ſhe ſeemed innocent to her husband, and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in fault. Moreouer, as here further is ſhewed, euen as ſome ſeruants, which haue eaten a thing, which they ſhould not, can cleanly wipe their mouthes, and make ſhew that they neuer touched it: ſo harlots, when they haue bene moſt vnchaſt, will ſeeme to be free from all vnchaſtirie. But albeit there neither is anie apparant ſigne of vnchaſtitie in the adulterer, which defileth the married or vnmarried woman, nor yet in the adultereſſe, which dealeth deceitfully with the guide of her youth: yet fornicators and adulterers ſaith the Apoſtle, the Lord will iudge. Their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is hid from men, but the Lord knoweth their thoughtes and their wordes. The wiſe cannot trace them, but he can detect them and finde them out.</p>

               <p>As there are foure ſecret things in the world: ſo are there foure vntollerable burthens of the earth, euen certain euill perſons of the generation of thoſe, who haue before bene affirmed to haue hautie eyes. One ſort of theſe verie troubleſome people are <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants that raigne,</hi> that is to ſay, men of a ſlauiſh diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, &amp; of a low condition, aduanced to high place, and as it were beggers ſet on horsbacke. Theſe will beate their fellow ſeruants, and play the tyrants, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the common people ordinarily well brooke them. Another ſort of vntollerable wretches are <hi>fooles filled with meate,</hi> that is to ſay, wicked men aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in wealth, or faring deliciouſly euery day. For theſe do nothing but deſpiſe the poore, as <hi>Naball</hi> did <hi>Dauid,</hi> decke themſelues in braue apparrell, neigh after their neighbours wiues, and ouer charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe. A third ſort of makebates, are <hi>wiues hated for their ill conditions</hi> or deſerts, who cauſe much ſtrife in the familie, and ſometimes great hurly burly in the common wealth. The Iewes as may appeare in diuerſe places of the ſcripture,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.15.</note> &amp; namely in Deuteronomie, had many of them, contrary to the law of God, two wiues. Now it fell out oftentimes that one of theſe was hated, the other loued. Hence ſprang much enuy, much griefe and ſtrife, as may appeare in <hi>Rahell</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi> and in <hi>Annt</hi> &amp; <hi>Perimnah.</hi> Yea although the married woman be the onely wife of her husband: yet if ſhe be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his eyes, ſhe not onely is vexed her ſelfe: but moleſteth him and the whole houſhold beſides. Now if ſhe be alſo put away by a bill of diuorce, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth another, this muſt needs be an occaſion of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter variance and miſchiefe. The laſt ſort of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of humane ſocieties, are <hi>handmaides, which are made heires to their miſtreſſes,</hi> that is to ſay, ſuch maide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruants as ſucceed them in goods, fauour, &amp; place. For theſe ſeruants, when as once they are married to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:13294:163"/>their maiſters, commonly know not how to vſe their proſperitie aright, but deale very inſolently as <hi>Agar</hi> did. Hence ariſe complaintes of the ſeruants, of the children, yea of the husband himſelfe oftentimes.</p>

               <p>As ſundrie ſorts of vices haue their pictures in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: ſo likewiſe haue ſundry kindes of vertues, for to begin with wiſedome the light and guide of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, there are ſundry creatures which being prudent in their kindes, may teach men in many points to be wiſer then commonly they are. Firſt the Ant a poore ſillie worme, yet by an inſtinct of nature, giuen to labour and forecaſting, prouideth neceſſaries long aforehand. Not onely philoſophers witneſſe, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth, that ſhe trudging and drudging vp and downe, whileſt yet the ſeed is abroad in the field in the ſummer time, and the weather is faire, hoordeth vp prouiſion againſt the winter. Again, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe is but a ſmall and weak creature, yet doth ſhe carry graines ſometimes euen bigger then her bodie. And now then what a ſhame were it for men, that the Ant ſhould toyle in ſuch ſort for the getting of her prouiſion, the Ant obſerue the ſeaſon of her aduantage, the Ant foreſee the ſtate of times to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:13294:164"/>to come: but they, indued with reaſon, with learning, with Religion, neglect the gathering of the foode of their ſoules, let ſlip the opportunities of their beſt bargaines about matters of this life, or not forecaſt or preuent future dangers? Indeed ſome are weake in body but if feebleneſſe hinder not the ant from hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping her eſtate, why ſhould it a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> releeuing his?</p>
               <p>Secondly the hill miſe, certaine little beaſts like partly to a mouſe, partly to a beare, whereof was great ſtore in Siria, haue their habitation in a rocke. Albeit they haue no weapons to defend them ſelues with, nor ſtrength of limmes: yet this wit they haue, to digge or finde out holes in ſtony places, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to flie vpon occaſion, and wherein to lay their young ones ſafely. If the contemptible miſe haue ſuch wit in prouiding well for their owne ſafetie, as alſo of their young ones: much more in men ſhould this reaſon be found, as alſo the meanes vſed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to make their eſtate ſecure. This is to be done by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> principally by flying to God in prayer, by building on the rocke Chriſt Ieſus, finally by ſeating them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, where are the exerciſes of the word: But ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they may alſo, yea they ought to vſe the protection of Magiſtrats, the helpe of friends, the aduiſe of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude whatſoeuer perſon or thing, may be a refuge vnto them againſt wrong or iniurie.</p>
               <p>As concerning the locuſtes, whether they go forth to ſolace them ſelues, or whether to deſtroy a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, this propertie they haue, that continually they keepe companie together, not onely holding their ſtanding places or obſeruing their opportunities of riſing vp &amp; reſting, but in all reſpectes marching as it were in battaile aray. Theſe locuſtes are certaine flies with long legges, which by touching the corne burne it in part and deuoure the reſidue. Now by reaſon of their flocking in ſuch heapes it commeth to paſſe, that although if they were ſeuerall alone or
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:13294:164"/>a ſunder one by one, they might eaſily be deſtroyed. yet being in multitudes, yea armies as it were,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.</note> great hoſts of men are not able to reſiſt them, as appeareth in the Scripture. When as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe creatures which are weake neither haue any Captaine to lead them, thus ioyne hand in hand, and liue in concord, what a ſhame is it for men, which haue the word of God and rulers among them to be their guides, yet to be ſo wonderfully diuided as they are oftentimes, yea ſo infinitly drawen a ſunder, as that ſcant foure or fiue ſhalbe found in a great aſſembly profeſſing the ſame Goſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, who ioyne in the ſame good cauſe, or hold the ſame opinion, or are vnited by the ſame affections together? <hi>But behold</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>how good and pleaſant a thing it is for brethran to dwel euen together:</hi> yea behold this I ſay in the Locuſts.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all the ſpider is a creature very contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, but her art doth greatly helpe her, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend her. For ſhe vſing her feete on both ſides as hands to worke, ſpinneth ſo fine a thread, &amp; frameth ſo curious a web, that ſhe ſeemeth to build vnto her ſelfe, and to inhabite not a poore or rude cotage, but a Princely and glorious pallace. Let vs then learne by her example this point of wiſedome, to ſtriue euen to excell in ſome trade or gift of minde. For the art will mainteine the artificer, yea oft the gift, which is excellent, aduaunceth him which is therewith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, vnto an high place of dignitie in Church or common wealth, as may appeare in the examples of <hi>Ioſeph, Daniell, Dauid,</hi> with diuers others mentioned in the Scripture. The ſpider is not to be followed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede in her venemous diſpoſition, but in her art to imitate her is a prayſe. Wherefore the vertuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is commended in the chapter enſuing for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her hands to the wherue, and her fingers to the ſpindle. Before alſo it hath bene ſaid in this booke <hi>Seeſt thou a man, which is diligent in his affaires, he ſhall ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

The firſt of theſe is the <hi>lion,</hi> which going to any place trembleth not by the way nor flyeth backe, though he ſee the eliphant or the tiger or the beare, but proceedeth on forward with a valiant courage.

The third is the <hi>goate,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ringleader of the flocke, not onely walketh before the ſame, with a certaine ſtatelineſſe, but with chearefulneſſe, firſt, in the ſight of the reſt, climeth vp the craggie rockes and mountaines. The laſt is <hi>a king,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:13294:165"/>againſt whom none riſeth vp,</hi> or on whom a moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gard of his officers attendeth, before whom the enemies quake, for whom the ſubiectes pray, vnto whom all, that are vnder his iuriſdiction, yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

Againe girding vp his loynes as the horſe he encountereth with his aduerſaries and taketh vengeance on them. To conclude imitating the goate in this reſpect, he leadeth by his example the people committed to his charge vnto all vertuous actions and exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. In theſe reſpectes the Scriptures ſometimes compare the Monarches of this world vnto theſe beaſts, as namely in the 7. and 8. of <hi>Daniell.</hi> But in as much as theſe patternes of comelineſſe are propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Neuertheleſſe euery one is to take heed that he be not too ſtately, or lift vp him ſelfe againſt his neighbour, into which ſinne yet if any through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie haue fallen, he is to recouer him ſelfe out of the ſame by following that diuine counſaile, which is giuen in the verſes following.</p>

The firſt reaſon is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the bond of nature, <hi>what my ſonne?</hi> This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may thus be concluded, a ſonne ought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his parents, thou art my ſon: thou oughteſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to obey me. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, is drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right of deſert. <hi>What ô ſonne of my wombe?</hi> Thus it may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he which hath bene bought moſt dearely, ought to obey moſt dutifully, thou haſt coſt me much paine, thou oughteſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with all reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to kearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to my voyce. The third is deriued from the rule of pietie or Religion, <hi>and what ô ſonne of my vowes?</hi> It may thus be made plaine, he for whoſe welfare ſacrifices haue bene offred and promiſes made vnto the Lord from time to time, is tyed in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience to obey that perſon in lawfull things, who hath made and performed ſuch ſolemne vowes in his behalfe, thou art he for whom ſacrifices haue bene offred, and I am ſhe who for
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:13294:167"/>hath made ſuch vowes, conſcience then bindeth thee to heare and regard my preceptes.</p>

               <p>The Preface being finiſhed, certaine preceptes now follow, wherein <hi>Bathſheba</hi> partly informeth <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> how to carrie him ſelfe in the gouernment of the common wealth, and partly directeth him as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the eſtate of a priuate familie. The former kind of inſtruction is of two ſortes, the one ſhewing what vices <hi>Salomon</hi> is eſpecially to ſhunne, the other decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what duties he is to practiſe. The former vice from which <hi>Bathſheba</hi> diſſwadeth her ſonne, is forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <hi>Giue not thy ſtrength vnto women, nor thy wayes to them who cauſe kings to be deſtroyed.</hi>

               <p>The ſecond vice from which <hi>Bathſheba</hi> diſſwadeth <hi>Salomon,</hi> is drunkenneſſe, whereof ſhe ſpeaketh in theſe words. <hi>Farre be it from Kings ô Lemoel, &amp;c.</hi> The vſe of wine is not forbidden Princes in theſe wordes,<note place="margin">See a precept of this kinde, Leuit. <hi>10.9.</hi> &amp; <hi>1.</hi> Tim. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> but the abuſe or immoderate vſe therof, from which as priuate perſons ſhould be farre off, ſo eſpecially magiſtrates. Great cauſe there is why rulers aboue all other people ſhould take heed of bibbing in wine, <hi>Leſt they drinke and forget the decree &amp;c:</hi> ſeeing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they being ouerſhot, may ſo for the time looſe their wits, as that they neither can remember the written law, nor diſcerne the truth. Rather then, <hi>Giue ye ſtrong drinke vnto him that is readie to periſh, and wine vnto them that are bitter in heart.</hi> In this verſe is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſtrong drinke which is poyſon to Princes, is a medicine to the afflicted. The ſenſe of it is this, reach out a large cup of comfortable drinke to that party, who by reaſon of famine or weakneſſe, or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, is at deaths doore. Beſtow alſo a good cup of wine, (which creature maketh glad the hart of man,) on him, who in conſideration of his loſſes or croſſes, is ſwallowed vp with extreme ſorrow. <hi>Let him drinke that he may forget his affliction, and remember his miſery no more.</hi> Let him, who by reaſon of ſome outward aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie is readie to periſh, take a plentifull draught of ſtrong drinke, that being therewith refreſhed, he may not thinke of the matter of his affliction. Moreouer, affoord a large cup of wine to him who is inwardly troubled in mind, that by this meanes the thorne of griefe which pricketh his hart, may wholly or in ſome part be pulled out. It is farre from the intent of the ſpirit of God, to allow exceſſe or carowſing in anie, neither doth the doctrine confirme or warrant the corrupt cuſtome of offering ſtrong drinke either to malefactors drawne to execution, or to ſicke perſons
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:13294:168"/>labouring on their deaths beds for life, at which time they ought to be moſt ſober and watchfull. Onelie, theſe inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s tend to declare, that ſome, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe who are in extreme aduerſitie, cannot onely beare a large quantitie of ſtrong drink without hurt, but receiue much good thereby, which being taken in the ſame meaſure by ſome in proſperitie or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, would vtterly ouerthrow them, or make them vnfit to follow their callings.</p>

Diuerſe huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands are ſo wicked and dogged to their wiues, that although they be not onely well giuen, but ſo painful and gainfull in their callings, that they euen by their induſtrie maintaine all; yet they keepe them often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without a peny in their purſe, neither will they

But (to conclude this point &amp; therwith this treatiſe) the praiſe of a vertuous woman is here ſo largely ſet down, and ſo exactly handled, not only to the end that <hi>Salomon</hi> might be directed in the choiſe of his wife, but that the price of ſuch a iewell, being made knowne to all, the goodneſſe of the Lord in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuch an helper to man, may appeare the more clearely, ſuch an helper I ſay, as may not only greatly further him in the affaires of this life, but as a fellow heire of glorie, go hand in hand with him vnto heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there to remaine for euer with Chriſt, in whom is neither male nor female, who is the head of man as man is the head of the woman, but the head of Chriſt is God euen the Father, to whom with the Sonne, and the Spirit, three incomprehenſible perſons in one infinite eſſence, be all praiſe and glorie, both now and for euermore.
